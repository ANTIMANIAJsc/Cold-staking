# Cold staking protocol 2.0 for EVM-compatible blockchain projects

Reference implementation of smart-contract based cold staking protocol. Formal descriptin will be released later.

This version of the protocol allows to `claim()` a full size of reward that was earned during a certain period (no custom staking interval, no staking gap), thus, less stressing the network with `claim()` transactions.

The protocol is currently in proof of concept phase.
